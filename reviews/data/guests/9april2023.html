                            <i>
                                This guest review comes courtesy of our west coast correspondent,
                                Syd Feldman, writing from sunny Los Angeles. Syd is a longtime supporter of S!TII, a high school
                                flame of co-founder Peter Addison, and an incisive critic who doesn't pull her punches.
                                We're very excited to welcome her and her expertise to the S!TII family.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I absolutely love soup. But I also don't really eat meat, so most of my canned soup intake
                            consists of Amy's plant-based products. Those are fine soups, but for my special guest
                            review on S!TII I really wanted to give the audience something exciting.
                            That's why I'm thinking outside the can this week and reviewing Nongshim's "Gourmet Spicy"
                            Shin Noodle Soup. At just 5.99 for a pack of 4, this soup is on the lower end of soup costs
                            over all, but definitely on the higher end of prepackaged ramen. And in my not-so-humble opinion,
                            it's worth every penny.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            When Nongshim said "Gourmet", they were not messing around. You can immediately tell by
                            the yellowness of the dehydrated egg noodles that their quality is much higher than your
                            typical beige-colored instant ramen. The noodles are thick, tastey, and they soak up the soup
                            flavor without turning to mush. In addition to the noodles and soup base, there is a packet
                            of dried vegetable flakes, which rehydrate in your broth and become delightful little
                            pieces of mushroom, green onion, and pepper.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Now onto the soup base and y'all, when Nongshim said "Spicy" they were ALSO not messing around.
                            The perfectly balanced flavors of garlic, red & black pepper, and MSG will have your mouth watering
                            - but also your eyes. I know many people who will only use half the base or less to season
                            their soup, but I always empty my entire packet. It hurts so good going in, and it hurts so bad coming out. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <i>"But Syd, why would you eat something that's going to hurt you later??"</i> I challenge you to find
                            a love that exists without pain. When you really love something, you give it the ability to hurt you.
                            Much like I was destined to destroy Peter Addison's heart in the 12th grade, this soup is destined to
                            destroy your asshole. But if you let the inevitability of pain keep you from experiencing something
                            beautiful? I feel sorry for you.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Run, don't walk, to your nearest Ralph's and get yourself some of the gourmet spicy.
                            You can thank me later (and then curse me even later than that).
